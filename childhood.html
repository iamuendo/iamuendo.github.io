            <h2>My journey of growth and discovery</h2>
            <p>
              I grew up in a humble setting, my early years were filled with
              both simple joys and valuable lessons that laid the foundation for
              his character and future pursuits. My curiosity got me in trouble
              quite abit but it also helped me to gain valuable skills like I
              used to tear down electronic gadgets and see how they work. I got
              very interest in electronics when I was in class four. Used to
              keep a screwdriver around to fix things.
            </p>
            <p>
              My childhood was filled with great memories of adventure,
              discovery, and the strong bonds of family. Whether it was playing
              with friends, helping my mom with daily chores, or picking up new
              skills, each moment played a role in shaping who I am today. I was
              fortunate to have a very supportive system, and I am deeply
              grateful to the mentors I have met along the way from primary
              school through to the present whose guidance continues to inspire
              me on my journey.
